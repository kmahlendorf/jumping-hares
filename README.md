# Jumping Hares

Jumping Hares is a small card game about breeding hares.

The objective of the game is to breed a hare that can jump over an obstacle that is both high and wide.  
The player receives a starting deck consisting of hares that carry either a recessive gene that enables high jumping or a dominant gene that allows the animal to jump far.  
The game can only be completed by combining those traits in one hare.
